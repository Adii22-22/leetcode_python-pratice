# LeetCode 1342: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
# Date solved: Dec 4, 2025
# Approach: Simulation / Bit Logic
# Explanation:
#   If the number is even, divide it by 2 (one operation). If the number is odd,
#   subtract 1 (one operation). Repeat this process until the number becomes 0.
#   This directly follows the rules given in the problem.
# Time Complexity: O(log n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

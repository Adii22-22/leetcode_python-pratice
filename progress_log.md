## Overview

Goal: Build strong Python fundamentals, consistent problem-solving habits, and a project portfolio for backend development.

Current Focus:
- Daily LeetCode practice (minimum 2 problems/day)
- Building small Python CLI projects
- Maintaining GitHub activity and commit streak

## Planned Routine

- Daily:
  - Solve 2 LeetCode problems
  - Update solutions and README on GitHub
  - Make one Git commit minimum

- Weekly:
  - Refactor or enhance one mini-project
  - Push all changes and maintain documentation

- Monthly:
  - Add one new Python CLI or API-based project
  - Summarize total problems solved and new skills learned

---

## Current Stats (as of Nov 7, 2025)
- LeetCode Problems Solved: 10
- Python Projects Completed: 3
- GitHub Repositories: 1 main (Simple Mini Projects)
- Active Learning Phase: Data Structures & Algorithms

---

## Notes
- Working on consistency and regular uploads to GitHub.
- Plan to update LeetCode folder daily with 2 problems until fully caught up with solved list.
- Next project idea: Basic File Organizer (Python CLI).
